## The-Real-Jigsaw

This is an awesome and a next level Jigsaw puzzle game that you have never seen. The game contains three modes: **World Mode**, **Custom Mode** and **Special Mode**. The **World Mode** allows the user to create Jigsaw puzzle of the real world. The users may either use the rear camera to create a puzzle of the real world or the front camera of their android phone to create a Jigsaw puzzle of their face in various modes like **3x3**, **4x4** or **5x5**. 
The **Custom Mode** allows the user to play the game just like a conventional Jigsaw game.
The **Special Mode** allows the user to apply various filters like Green, Blue, Red etc. to the images captured by their camera and then create a Jigsaw puzzle out of it.
The users may see the list of all puzzles played by them and the corresponding scores in the **My Scores** section. The **Leaderboard** contains the high scores of all the users.
